            <ab>The nature, and indeed the reality, of Romanization in the <placeName>east</placeName> is controversial. One
        of the most influential accounts of Romanization in the western provinces notes that
        'by contrast, where <name>Greek</name> was already the language of culture, of government and of
        inter-regional trade, the <name>Romans</name> carried further the process of Hellenization ... in
        general what was specifically <name>Latin</name> in the common civilization of the <nameempire made
        little impact in the <placeName>east</placeName>', the exceptions being the influence of Roman law and the
        popularity of gladiatorial games.1</ab>
